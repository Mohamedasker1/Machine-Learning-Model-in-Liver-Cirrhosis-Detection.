# Machine-Learning-Model-in-Liver-Cirrhosis-Detection.
Liver cirrhosis is the most prevalent form of chronic liver disease in the world. Being able to foresee when the disease will manifest is crucial for effective treatment and the avoidance of severe health implications. The earlier this illness is diagnosed, the greater the chance of successful treatment.

So, I have decided to develop a machine-learning model for detecting liver cirrhosis. This will significantly aid medical staff in diagnosing liver cirrhosis by analyzing an image of the liver.

The model is based on image classification. I will train the model on a large dataset of images or CT-Scan of cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic livers so that it can distinguish between the two. After that, the model can analyze an image of the liver and determine whether it is cirrhotic or not. This is because cirrhosis is one of the diseases that can be diagnosed by analyzing the shape of the liver.

#I used the Jupiter notebook to write the code

In the model I used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) a type of deep neural network
The accuracy of the model is 85%

The dataset consisted of CT-scaans of a cirrhotic liver and a normal liver.
